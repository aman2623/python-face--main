# Face Recognition Based Attendance System  

## Overview  
This project is a **Python-based GUI-integrated attendance system** that uses **face recognition** to mark attendance. The system captures and recognizes faces using **OpenCV** and stores attendance records in **CSV files**. It also includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **Tkinter**, making it user-friendly for schools, colleges, and workplaces.  

## Features  
âœ… **Face Recognition** â€“ Uses OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer for accurate face recognition.  
âœ… **GUI-based Interface** â€“ Built with Tkinter for ease of use.  
âœ… **Automatic Attendance Recording** â€“ Saves attendance details (ID, Name, Date, Time) in CSV files.  
âœ… **Daily Attendance Logs** â€“ Creates a new attendance file for each day.  
âœ… **Password Protection** â€“ Ensures security when registering new students.  
âœ… **Live Attendance Display** â€“ Shows attendance details in tabular format.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Tkinter** â€“ GUI framework  
- **OpenCV** â€“ Face detection & recognition  
- **NumPy** â€“ Array processing  
- **Pandas** â€“ Data management  
- **CSV Handling** â€“ Stores student details & attendance records  
- **Datetime & Time** â€“ Timestamps for attendance tracking  

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python** installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using the following commands:  
```bash
pip install tk-tools
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install datetime
pip install pytest-shutil
pip install python-csv
pip install numpy
pip install pillow 
pip install pandas
pip install times

Usage
Run the Application
python main.py
Register Students
Enter the studentâ€™s ID and Name.
The system captures multiple face images for recognition.
Mark Attendance
The system detects and recognizes faces in real-time.
Attendance is automatically logged with a timestamp.
View Attendance Records
Attendance details are saved in daily CSV files for easy tracking.
